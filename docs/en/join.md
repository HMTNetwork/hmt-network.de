## 🎮 Consoles (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch)
Since consoles do not allow custom server IPs by default, you have to use a small trick. Here are the most common methods:
If you need more detailed help, feel free to watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLPhKW2Xis) or ask on our Discord.

### Method A: "Bedrock Together" App (Recommended)
1. Download the app **"Bedrock Together"** (free in the App Store / Google Play Store) on your phone.
2. Start the app and enter the IP `bedrock.hmt-network.de` and port `19132`.
3. Click on "Watch Ad and Run".
4. Start Minecraft on your console and go to the **Friends** tab.
5. A "LAN Game" named "BedrockTogether" will appear. Join it, and you will be automatically forwarded to our network.

### Method B: DNS Workaround
You can change the DNS server in your console's network settings to unlock a server list. If you need help with this, feel free to ask a staff member on Discord!
