# Teams & Guilds

On the HMT-Network, you don't have to fight alone. Our team system allows you to form solid alliances with other players, create a shared identity, and protect each other.

## Why found a team?
* **Organization:** Keep track of your friends.
* **Unity:** Build bases together and defend them in battles.
* **Identity:** Your team name represents your group across the entire server.

## Important Commands

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/team create {Name}` | Founds a new team with you as the leader. |
| `/team invite {Player}` | Invites a player to your team. |
| `/team join {Name}` | Joins a team (after an invitation). |
| `/team leave` | Leave your current team. |
| `/team kick {Player}` | Removes a member (leader only). |
| `/team promote {Player}` | Promotes a member within the guild. |

## Team Rules & Fair Play
Our network rules also apply within teams:
1. **Insiding:** Intentionally joining a team to steal items or destroy the base is discouraged and may be sanctioned by staff depending on the severity.
2. **Team Size:** Currently, there is no hard limit on the number of members, but we reserve the right to adjust this in the future for game balance.
3. **Names:** Team names that violate chat rules (insults, discrimination) will lead to the immediate dissolution of the team and a penalty for the founder.

## Tips for Leaders
* Choose your members wisely! In the Closed Beta, trust is the most important asset.
* Only use promotions for players you have known for a long time, as they receive administrative rights within your team.
