# Crates & Rewards

The crate system on HMT-Network rewards active players with valuable items, cosmetic extras, or rare building materials. You can find the crates at central locations like the **Spawn** or in the **Lobby**.

## How do I get Crate Keys?
Since we are a fair network without real-money purchases, you can only earn keys through gameplay:
* **Playtime:** Receive keys simply by actively playing on the server.
* **Events:** Participate in community events organized by the team.
* **In-Game Shop:** Occasionally, basic keys can be purchased for virtual Euro (€) in the `/shop`.

## Available Crates
| Crate Type | Rarity | Possible Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Copper Crate** | Common | Food, basic ores, tools. |
| **Gold Crate** | Exclusive | Rare items for Beta testers, decoration. |
| **Emerald Crate** | Rare | Diamond gear, totems, crystals, ranks. |
| **Diamond Crate** | Legendary | Rare ranks, Shulker boxes, rare heads. |

## Commands
* `/crates` or `/cc` - Opens the overview of available crates and shows how many keys you own.
* Left-click on a crate at Spawn shows you the winning chances (Preview).
* Right-click with a matching key opens the crate.
