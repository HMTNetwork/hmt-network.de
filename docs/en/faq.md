# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### Do the rank or the currency cost real money?
No. HMT-Network is completely free to play. Currency (€) and ranks are earned through playtime, events, or special achievements.

### What happens after the Closed Beta?
We are currently in the testing phase. It is possible that an official **Reset** (Wipe) will be performed for the official release so that all players start with the same chances. However, Beta testers often receive a small reward as a thank you.

### I'm playing on a console and can't find the server.
Please take a look at our [Join Guide](join.md). Consoles need a small workaround (DNS or mobile app) to join external servers.

### How do I report a bug or a cheater?
We rely on your feedback! Please report errors or suspicious players directly to a team member or use the corresponding channel in our Discord.

### Can I apply for Staff?
When we are looking for reinforcements, we will announce it officially. Active and helpful players in the Beta always have good chances!
